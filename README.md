🏠 House Price Prediction

Predicting house prices in Mumbai using machine learning, where users can input house features, and the model accurately predicts the price with an impressive R² score of ~0.95

📂 Project Overview

This project builds a powerful house price prediction system tailored for Mumbai's real estate market. By leveraging Random Forest Regressor, the model learns complex relationships between various house features — like bedrooms, location, and amenities — and their impact on price. Users can dynamically select the features they care about, provide the corresponding values, and instantly get a predicted price. The program also visualizes data trends, helping users understand price distribution across different factors, making it a valuable tool for buyers, sellers, and investors.

🚀 Features

Dynamic Feature Selection: Users can choose relevant features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and location.

User-Friendly Input: Collects feature values through console prompts.

Data Handling: Manages missing values and cleans the dataset.

Visualization: Generates insightful charts for data exploration.

High Accuracy: Achieves a remarkable R² score of ~0.95.
